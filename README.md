#### Important Note
***
Be sure to replace /Client/data/prime.dmp with a stronger prime generated by running /Util/generate_prime.py before serious use. The current file is only to be used for testing purposes and as such is a very weak 16 bit prime, at least 2048 bits should be used. Eventually this message will disappear and I'll replace /Client/data/prime.dmp, generating a suitably large prime takes some time and I don't have much patience.
